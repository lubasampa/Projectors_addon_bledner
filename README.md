# Projector Add-on for Blender
Simple projector creation and modification for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

## What this Add-on can do for you
* Easy creation and modification of physically-based projectors.
* Real-world projector settings like [throw ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throw_(projector)), [resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_display_standard) and [lens shift](https://www.projectorcentral.com/Understanding-Lens-Offset-and-Lens-Shift.htm).
* Project test textures or your own content like images and videos.
* Preview the projections in Cycles render mode (Eevee will be supported when the needed functionality is implemented).

## Projectors Add-on in Action

#### Throw Ratio
Control the size of your projection by adjusting the throw ratio to match real-world projector specifications.

#### Lens Shift
Fine-tune the vertical and horizontal position of your projection without moving the projector itself.

#### Image Textures & Resolution
Load your own images or videos and set custom resolutions to match your projection content.

#### Random Color
Quickly assign random colors to distinguish multiple projectors in your scene.

## Projector Body and Saved Models
When creating a projector (`New`), the add-on opens a setup dialog where you can:
* Choose body type:
  * `No Body`
  * `Default Body` (parametric box with length/depth/height)
  * `Duplicate Active Object` (uses current active mesh as projector body copy)
* Set beam origin and direction:
  * `Emitter Offset` (where the projection starts from the body)
  * `Emitter Rotation` (beam direction in local coordinates)
* Projection cone preview:
  * `Show Projection Cone` creates a frustum preview that follows throw ratio, lens shift and aspect ratio
  * `Cone Length` controls only the cone depth
  * While cone is enabled, projector spot light is disabled; disabling cone restores spot light
* Save/reuse/delete projector models after projector creation:
  * Use `Saved Models` section in the projector panel
  * Save current setup with `Manufacturer` + `Model`
  * Apply or delete saved models later

## Note
* works with Blender 2.8 and up

## Wiki
* A growing [wiki](https://github.com/Ocupe/Projectors/wiki) to help users with this add-on. If you have problems or feel that something is missing, please feel free to request more content.

## Installation
* Download the add-on ZIP from the latest [GitHub Release](https://github.com/lubasampa/Projectors_addon_bledner/releases/latest).
* Do not use GitHub's **Code** -> **Download ZIP** for installation, because that archive contains repository files used only for development.
* Open Blender.
* Go to the User Preferences in the Addon tab.
* Click Install from File and choose the zip file you downloaded.
* Activate the add-on by clicking on the checkbox.

## Releases
* The latest release is `v2026.4.30`.
* Pushing a tag like `v2026.4.30` runs the release workflow and generates a clean add-on ZIP as a GitHub Release asset.

## Missing something?
I'm interested and open to suggestions. Let me know how you use the add-on and how it could improve. Open an issue or message me.

P.S. Germans like to call a projector, a beamer.
